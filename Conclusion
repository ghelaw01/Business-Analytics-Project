This study validates the hypothesis that socioeconomic factors, particularly parental education and access to resources, significantly influence student performance. The findings underscore the need for education policies that promote equity, ensuring that all students, regardless of background, have equal opportunities to succeed.

Future research should explore additional factors such as teacher influence, peer effects, and school infrastructure to provide a more comprehensive understanding of the determinants of academic success.
