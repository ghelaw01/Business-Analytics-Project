The results align with prior research emphasizing the role of socioeconomic status in shaping academic achievement. The clustering and regression models confirm that parental education and access to resources significantly impact student outcomes.

Key Takeaways:
Students from higher SES backgrounds tend to perform better academically due to better access to learning materials, structured home environments, and parental involvement.
Test preparation courses have a positive impact, suggesting that structured interventions can help bridge achievement gaps.
Lunch type as a proxy for income level indicates that students from lower-income families are at a disadvantage, reinforcing the need for policy interventions.
Research Gap & Implications
Despite the robust findings, this study does not account for external factors such as teacher quality, school funding, and community influences, which could also contribute to academic performance disparities. Future research should incorporate longitudinal data to assess how these factors evolve over time.

From a policy perspective, these results emphasize the importance of targeted educational interventions to support students from lower socioeconomic backgrounds. Programs such as free tutoring, extended learning hours, and increased parental engagement initiatives could help mitigate disparities in student achievement.
