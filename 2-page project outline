Project Outline: Dynamic Customer Segmentation for Predictive Stock Replenishment
1. Dataset Description
The dataset for this project is the Online Retail Business Cleaned Dataset, which contains transactional records from a UK-based online retailer spanning from December 2010 to December 2011. The dataset is publicly available and has been pre-processed to ensure cleanliness and usability for analysis.
Dataset Characteristics:
•	Source: UK-based online retail transactional data
•	Number of Data Points: Approximately 500,000 transaction records
•	Key Variables:
o	Invoice No: Unique identifier for each transaction
o	Stock Code: Unique identifier for each product
o	Description: Product description
o	Quantity: Number of units sold per transaction
o	InvoiceDate: Date and time of the transaction
o	Unit Price: Price per unit of the product
o	CustomerID: Unique identifier for each customer
o	Country: Country of the customer
o	Total Price: Derived feature (Quantity × Unit Price)
Data preprocessing includes handling missing values, removing anomalies (e.g., negative quantities for returns), and filtering data to focus on UK-based transactions for consistency.
2. Planned Analytics Techniques
Our analysis will incorporate a combination of machine learning and statistical techniques to extract insights from the dataset:
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
•	Understanding sales trends over time
•	Identifying top-selling products
•	Examining customer purchasing behavior (frequency, recency, monetary value)
Customer Segmentation (Unsupervised Learning):
•	Applying K-Means Clustering based on Recency, Frequency, and Monetary (RFM) values to group customers into distinct segments:
o	High-value, frequent buyers
o	Moderate-value customers
o	Seasonal buyers
o	Low-frequency buyers
Predictive Stock Replenishment (Time Series Forecasting):
•	Using Prophet, a robust forecasting algorithm, to predict future product demand based on historical sales patterns.
•	Identifying seasonal trends and peak demand periods.
3. Expected Insights and Results
Through our analysis, we aim to uncover insights that will help businesses optimize inventory management by linking customer segmentation to demand forecasting.
Key Insights Anticipated:
✔ Identification of distinct customer segments with tailored inventory strategies for each. 
✔ Improved demand forecasting to reduce stockouts and overstocking. 
✔ Insights into seasonal purchasing behavior, allowing businesses to adjust stock levels proactively. 
✔ Data-driven recommendations for personalized promotions based on customer segmentation. 
✔ Cost reduction in warehouse storage and procurement by optimizing replenishment cycles.
By leveraging machine learning and predictive analytics, we hope to enhance e-commerce inventory management strategies, ultimately leading to increased profitability and customer satisfaction.
