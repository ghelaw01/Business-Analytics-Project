The relationship between socioeconomic status and academic performance has been extensively studied across various educational contexts. Coleman et al. (1966) conducted a seminal study revealing that family background significantly influences student achievement, often outweighing the effects of school resources. This finding has been corroborated by subsequent research emphasizing the critical role of SES in shaping educational outcomes.

Sirin (2005) performed a meta-analytic review quantifying the relationship between SES and academic performance, demonstrating a medium to strong correlation. Similarly, White (1982) found that parental education and occupation are significant predictors of student achievement, highlighting the multifaceted nature of SES influences.

Bradley and Corwyn (2002) highlighted that higher SES families often provide enriched learning environments, characterized by access to educational materials, extracurricular activities, and stimulating interactions, all of which foster cognitive development. Moreover, high-SES parents are more likely to engage in practices that promote academic success, such as reading to their children and setting high educational expectations (Davis-Kean, 2005).

School-related factors also mediate the relationship between SES and student performance. Lareau (2011) observed that children from higher SES backgrounds benefit from concerted cultivation, wherein parents actively organize and participate in their children's educational experiences, leading to advantages in school settings. Conversely, students from lower SES backgrounds may face challenges such as limited access to quality schools, experienced teachers, and advanced coursework (Reardon, 2011).

The psychological dimension is another critical facet. Eccles et al. (1993) posited that SES influences children's academic self-concept and motivation, with higher SES students exhibiting greater confidence in their academic abilities. This self-assuredness often translates into higher academic aspirations and resilience in the face of challenges.

Despite the robust evidence linking SES to academic performance, some studies suggest that the relationship is not deterministic. Rothstein (2004) argued that while SES provides certain advantages, school interventions and policies can mitigate its impact. For instance, programs targeting early childhood education and parental involvement have shown promise in bridging the achievement gap associated with socioeconomic disparities (Heckman, 2006).

In summary, the literature underscores a significant association between socioeconomic factors and student academic performance. The influence of SES manifests through various channels, including home environment, parental involvement, school quality, and psychological factors. However, the extent of this impact and the potential for mitigating strategies warrant further exploration, particularly in diverse educational contexts.
