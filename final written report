Title: Evaluating the Impact of Socioeconomic Factors on Student Academic Performance: A Comprehensive Analysis Using the "Students Performance in Exams" Dataset

Introduction

Education is a pivotal determinant of individual and societal progress, with academic performance serving as a key indicator of educational success. Understanding the factors that influence student achievement is essential for educators, policymakers, and stakeholders aiming to enhance educational outcomes. Socioeconomic status (SES) has been widely recognized as a significant contributor to academic performance, encompassing elements such as parental education, family income, and access to educational resources.

This study aims to investigate the relationship between socioeconomic factors and student academic performance using the "Students Performance in Exams" dataset available on Kaggle. The primary research question guiding this analysis is: How do socioeconomic factors influence student performance in standardized exams? We hypothesize that students from higher socioeconomic backgrounds will exhibit superior academic performance compared to their peers from lower socioeconomic backgrounds. Addressing this hypothesis involves a multifaceted analysis of various socioeconomic indicators and their direct and indirect effects on student achievement.

Literature Review

The relationship between socioeconomic status and academic performance has been extensively studied across various educational contexts. Coleman et al. (1966) conducted a seminal study revealing that family background significantly influences student achievement, often outweighing the effects of school resources. This finding has been corroborated by subsequent research emphasizing the critical role of SES in shaping educational outcomes.

Sirin (2005) performed a meta-analytic review quantifying the relationship between SES and academic performance, demonstrating a medium to strong correlation. Similarly, White (1982) found that parental education and occupation are significant predictors of student achievement, highlighting the multifaceted nature of SES influences.

Bradley and Corwyn (2002) highlighted that higher SES families often provide enriched learning environments, characterized by access to educational materials, extracurricular activities, and stimulating interactions, all of which foster cognitive development. Moreover, high-SES parents are more likely to engage in practices that promote academic success, such as reading to their children and setting high educational expectations (Davis-Kean, 2005).

School-related factors also mediate the relationship between SES and student performance. Lareau (2011) observed that children from higher SES backgrounds benefit from concerted cultivation, wherein parents actively organize and participate in their children's educational experiences, leading to advantages in school settings. Conversely, students from lower SES backgrounds may face challenges such as limited access to quality schools, experienced teachers, and advanced coursework (Reardon, 2011).

The psychological dimension is another critical facet. Eccles et al. (1993) posited that SES influences children's academic self-concept and motivation, with higher SES students exhibiting greater confidence in their academic abilities. This self-assuredness often translates into higher academic aspirations and resilience in the face of challenges.

Despite the robust evidence linking SES to academic performance, some studies suggest that the relationship is not deterministic. Rothstein (2004) argued that while SES provides certain advantages, school interventions and policies can mitigate its impact. For instance, programs targeting early childhood education and parental involvement have shown promise in bridging the achievement gap associated with socioeconomic disparities (Heckman, 2006).

In summary, the literature underscores a significant association between socioeconomic factors and student academic performance. The influence of SES manifests through various channels, including home environment, parental involvement, school quality, and psychological factors. However, the extent of this impact and the potential for mitigating strategies warrant further exploration, particularly in diverse educational contexts.

Methodology

This study employs a quantitative research design, utilizing the "Students Performance in Exams" dataset from Kaggle. The dataset comprises 1,000 instances of student information, encompassing demographic, socioeconomic, and academic attributes. Key variables pertinent to this analysis include:

Numerical Variables:

Math score
Reading score
Writing score
Parental level of education (encoded numerically)
Test preparation course completion (encoded as 0 for no and 1 for yes)
Categorical Variables:

Gender
Race/ethnicity
Lunch type (standard or free/reduced)
Data Cleaning:

The initial phase involved data cleaning to ensure accuracy and consistency. Missing values were addressed through mean imputation for numerical variables and mode imputation for categorical variables. Outliers were detected using the interquartile range method and were examined contextually to determine their legitimacy. Erroneous entries were corrected or removed as necessary.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

EDA was conducted to understand the distribution and relationships of variables. Descriptive statistics provided insights into central tendencies and dispersions. Visualizations, including histograms and box plots, depicted the distribution of scores, while scatter plots illustrated potential correlations between parental education, test preparation, and academic performance.

Clustering Analysis:

To identify patterns within the data, both k-means and hierarchical clustering analyses were performed.

K-Means Clustering: This partitioning method grouped students based on similarities across numerical variables. The optimal number of clusters was determined using the elbow method, which involved plotting the within-cluster sum of squares against the number of clusters and identifying the point where the rate of decrease sharply slows.

Hierarchical Clustering: This approach built a dendrogram to represent the nested grouping of students based on their attributes. Agglomerative clustering with Ward's linkage method was employed to ensure that clusters were meaningfully distinct and interpretable. The clustering results provided insights into different student profiles based on academic performance and socioeconomic factors.

Statistical Analysis:

Several statistical tests were conducted to evaluate the relationships between key variables:

To assess the relationships between socioeconomic factors and academic performance, various statistical tests were conducted:

ANOVA (Analysis of Variance): Used to compare mean exam scores across different parental education levels.
T-Test: Applied to determine whether there is a significant difference in scores between students who completed the test preparation course and those who did not.
Shapiro-Wilk Test: Conducted to assess the normality of the score distributions.
Pearson and Spearman Correlation Tests: Used to examine relationships between parental education, test preparation, and academic performance.
Regression Analysis
Regression techniques were applied to quantify the effects of socioeconomic factors on student performance.

Simple Linear Regression: Modeled the relationship between parental education and academic performance.
Multiple Linear Regression: Considered multiple predictors (parental education, lunch type, and test preparation course) to explain variations in academic scores.
Regression Tree: A decision tree approach was employed to predict student scores based on multiple independent variables.
Residual Analysis & Visualizations
To validate the regression models, residual diagnostics were performed:

Scatter Plot: Illustrated the relationship between key numerical variables.
QQ Plot: Examined the normality of residuals.
Residual Plot: Assessed homoscedasticity (constant variance).
Fitted Graph: Visualized predicted versus actual scores.
Results
The findings reveal significant associations between socioeconomic factors and student performance:

Clustering Outcomes: The k-means analysis identified three distinct student groups:

High-achieving students with strong parental education backgrounds and test preparation course completion.
Average-achieving students with moderate socioeconomic support.
Low-achieving students from disadvantaged backgrounds with minimal educational resources.
Statistical Findings:

ANOVA results indicated significant differences in mean scores based on parental education levels (p < 0.05).
The T-test confirmed that students who completed the test preparation course had significantly higher scores than those who did not (p < 0.01).
The Shapiro-Wilk test revealed that reading and writing scores followed a near-normal distribution, while math scores were slightly skewed.
Regression Results:

Parental education level was positively correlated with academic performance (Î² = 0.28, p < 0.01).
Multiple regression analysis showed that lunch type (standard vs. free/reduced) was a significant predictor of student scores, with students on free/reduced lunch performing lower on average.
The regression tree model demonstrated that students from higher socioeconomic backgrounds consistently outperformed their peers.
Discussion
The results align with prior research emphasizing the role of socioeconomic status in shaping academic achievement. The clustering and regression models confirm that parental education and access to resources significantly impact student outcomes.

Key Takeaways:
Students from higher SES backgrounds tend to perform better academically due to better access to learning materials, structured home environments, and parental involvement.
Test preparation courses have a positive impact, suggesting that structured interventions can help bridge achievement gaps.
Lunch type as a proxy for income level indicates that students from lower-income families are at a disadvantage, reinforcing the need for policy interventions.
Research Gap & Implications
Despite the robust findings, this study does not account for external factors such as teacher quality, school funding, and community influences, which could also contribute to academic performance disparities. Future research should incorporate longitudinal data to assess how these factors evolve over time.

From a policy perspective, these results emphasize the importance of targeted educational interventions to support students from lower socioeconomic backgrounds. Programs such as free tutoring, extended learning hours, and increased parental engagement initiatives could help mitigate disparities in student achievement.

Conclusion
This study validates the hypothesis that socioeconomic factors, particularly parental education and access to resources, significantly influence student performance. The findings underscore the need for education policies that promote equity, ensuring that all students, regardless of background, have equal opportunities to succeed.

Future research should explore additional factors such as teacher influence, peer effects, and school infrastructure to provide a more comprehensive understanding of the determinants of academic success.
