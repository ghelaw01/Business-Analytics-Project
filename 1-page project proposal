Project Focus Area
The project will focus on the e-commerce industry, specifically on improving inventory management through AI-driven customer segmentation and predictive stock replenishment.
Research Question / Challenge
How can dynamic customer segmentation be leveraged to improve predictive stock replenishment and optimize inventory management in e-commerce?
Brief Description of the Data
The dataset to be used is the Online Retail Business Cleaned Dataset, which consists of transactional records from a UK-based online retailer (2010-2011). Key variables include:
•	CustomerID: Unique customer identifier
•	Invoice No & InvoiceDate: Transaction details
•	Stock Code & Description: Product details
•	Quantity & Unit Price: Purchase information
•	Country: Customer location
The project will apply unsupervised machine learning (K-Means clustering) for customer segmentation and time series forecasting (Prophet) for demand prediction to help businesses improve stock management.
Expected Impact
By using AI-driven insights, businesses can:
✔ Reduce overstocking and minimize lost sales
✔ Improve customer satisfaction through better inventory planning
✔ Enable data-driven, dynamic stock replenishment strategies
