Statistical Analysis:

To assess the relationships between socioeconomic factors and academic performance, various statistical tests were conducted:

ANOVA (Analysis of Variance): Used to compare mean exam scores across different parental education levels.
T-Test: Applied to determine whether there is a significant difference in scores between students who completed the test preparation course and those who did not.
Shapiro-Wilk Test: Conducted to assess the normality of the score distributions.
Pearson and Spearman Correlation Tests: Used to examine relationships between parental education, test preparation, and academic performance.
Regression Analysis
Regression techniques were applied to quantify the effects of socioeconomic factors on student performance.

Simple Linear Regression: Modeled the relationship between parental education and academic performance.
Multiple Linear Regression: Considered multiple predictors (parental education, lunch type, and test preparation course) to explain variations in academic scores.
Regression Tree: A decision tree approach was employed to predict student scores based on multiple independent variables.
Residual Analysis & Visualizations
To validate the regression models, residual diagnostics were performed:

Scatter Plot: Illustrated the relationship between key numerical variables.
QQ Plot: Examined the normality of residuals.
Residual Plot: Assessed homoscedasticity (constant variance).
Fitted Graph: Visualized predicted versus actual scores
