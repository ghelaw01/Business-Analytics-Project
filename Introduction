1. Introduction

Education is a pivotal determinant of individual and societal progress, with academic performance serving as a key indicator of educational success. Understanding the factors that influence student achievement is essential for educators, policymakers, and stakeholders aiming to enhance educational outcomes. Socioeconomic status (SES) has been widely recognized as a significant contributor to academic performance, encompassing elements such as parental education, family income, and access to educational resources.

This study aims to investigate the relationship between socioeconomic factors and student academic performance using the "Students Performance in Exams" dataset available on Kaggle. The primary research question guiding this analysis is: How do socioeconomic factors influence student performance in standardized exams? We hypothesize that students from higher socioeconomic backgrounds will exhibit superior academic performance compared to their peers from lower socioeconomic backgrounds. Addressing this hypothesis involves a multifaceted analysis of various socioeconomic indicators and their direct and indirect effects on student achievement.
