1. Introduction

The e-commerce sector has witnessed exponential growth over the past decade, leading to an increased focus on efficient inventory management. Accurate demand forecasting and timely stock replenishment are critical components that influence customer satisfaction and profitability. Traditional inventory management approaches often rely on historical sales data and may not account for the dynamic nature of customer purchasing behaviors. This study proposes a dynamic customer segmentation model that leverages purchasing patterns to predict future inventory requirements, thereby enabling more responsive and efficient stock management.

1.1 Background

Inventory management is a complex process that involves balancing the costs associated with holding stock against the need to meet customer demand promptly. Overstocking can lead to increased holding costs and potential obsolescence, while understocking may result in missed sales opportunities and diminished customer loyalty. Traditional methods often employ aggregate sales data to forecast demand, which may overlook individual customer behaviors and emerging trends.

1.2 Objective

This study aims to develop a dynamic customer segmentation model that:

Identifies distinct customer segments based on purchasing behaviors.

Predicts future product demand for each segment.

Provides actionable insights for optimizing stock replenishment strategies.

1.3 Significance

By focusing on customer-level data, businesses can gain a more granular understanding of demand patterns, allowing for more precise inventory management. This approach not only enhances operational efficiency but also contributes to improved customer satisfaction by ensuring product availability aligns with customer expectations.
